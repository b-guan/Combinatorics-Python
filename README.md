# Combinatorics-Python
When given numerical inputs, n and p, the method countTriangles(n,p) will create a random instance that fullfills the following requirements:
1) There are n nodes
2) Each pair of nodes has p percent of forming an edge between them

and returns the number of triangles formed in that particular instance.

The method trials(t,n,p) will return will return the average number of triangles formed after running countTriangles t times as well as the expected number of triangles to form. The print statements can be altered to see different components of each instance created by countTriangles.
